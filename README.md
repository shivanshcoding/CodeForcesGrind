## 📌 About This Repository
This repository is my **daily grind on Codeforces** — a collection of solutions to problems I’ve solved while:  
- 🔥 Practicing **daily problem-solving**  
- 🏆 Participating in **Codeforces contests**  
- 📚 Strengthening **DSA + Algorithms** foundations  

It’s more than just code — it’s a **journey of consistency, growth, and sharpening problem-solving skills**.
